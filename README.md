# Face mask Detection

Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning and Computer Vision using webcam in real time

The Images used for training the deep learning model is a computer generated dataset by compining the facial detection and adding the mask using OpenCV.
Dataset used from [Source](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations)

I have tried 3 models, tested all of them , and found out lighter models work fine.

## Currently Working on

Currently working to train and test on **NVIDIA Jetson** so we can apply it in real world.

*Mobilenet v2* is used in this case and still not shared as it  is in development phase
